# World Weather Analysis
## Overview
This analysis looks at different weather patterns around the Earth and offers insights to travelers who want to book a trip. There are three folders here that offer different levels of analysis: basic weather database, vacation search, and vacation itinerary.

## Weather Database
This folder uses Open Weather Map API to pull weather information on more than 720 different cities around the world. That information consists of:
1.	Maximum Temperature
2.	Cloudiness
3.	Wind Speed
4.	Humidity
5.	Current Weather Description

These different categories of information make it easy for travelers to choose exactly what they are looking for in a travel destination.

## Vacation Search
This folder takes the information gained from the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot some travel destinations with a hotel at each location. For example, the image below shows the locations of all the places in the database that have an daily maximum temperature between 67 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Vacation Itinerary
This folder takes the search information from the search folder and uses Google Maps directions API to create a vacation itinerary. For example, the image below shows a 4 stop vacation itinerary for a vacation, starting in the Brazilian city of Maragogi, going from there to Jacobina, then to Caravelas, to  Aracuai, and finally returning to Maragogi.
